#### News API Algorithm

**I developed this algorithm to filter relevant news articles (by title) from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/)**

This function will accept input value(s) and:

- traverse through the response object from the News API
- check to see if input Value(s) are contained in title of article
- return an array with all articles that have input Value(s) in title

_Note: this algorithm will need customization if the response contains articles with input Value(s) that refer to separate things entirely_
